All `Tiles` will have the following attributes:
(x, y, owner, rotation, connections)
x, y: represent the position of the tile inside the board
owner: who placed a meeple into that tile
rotation: 1 - 0ยบ, 2 - 90ยบ, 3 - 180ยบ, 4 - 270ยบ
connections: represents which type of connections are possible
             for example: 'castle_A_3_pieces.PNG': ['C', 'C', 'F', 'C']
             where: C = Castle, F = Field

Rotations and Connections - How does it work together? Example with `castle_A_3_pieces.PNG`
* Rotation = 1, then connections = ['C', 'C', 'F', 'C']
* Rotation = 2,
